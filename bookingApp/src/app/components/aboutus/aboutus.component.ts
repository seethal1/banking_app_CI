As a wiki, AboutUs allows Internet users to add entries or modify information. AboutUs.com has since become a wiki for more than just websites. The site allows pages to be created for people, places, and almost anything else."
+"Ray King, Jay Westerdal, and Paul Stahura founded AboutUs in 2005. Later in 2006 a small staff of five people in Portland, Oregon, United States developed out the site. The staff expanded to more than thirty people and two continents with an office in Lahore, Pakistan. From May 2007 to early 2011, Ward Cunningham, developer of the first wiki, was the chief technology officer of AboutUs."
